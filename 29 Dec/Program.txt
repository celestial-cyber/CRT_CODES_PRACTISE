1. count of all digits 
2. sum of all the numbers 
3. sum of all digits until i get a single digit number 



n= 12345 
int c=0
while(n!=0){
    c++;
    n=n/10;
    //logic for logarithm - in how many times the number gets divided by 10 to obtain 0 - 

}

also int n = 12345 
so instead of using while loops for counting the numbers we can use logarithm of base 10 
int c = log10(n) + 1; //5

if i have 10 digits number then the log of 10 digits number will be 9 same goes with 5 digit number - we will get 4 as answer



we can't perform log on zero and negative numbers
